# PokemonGO evolve Generator

## Description
One of the recent updates to Pokemon GO gave the players a new tool - search through their Pokemon collection. Users began discovering tricks hidden inside that function - being able to filter specific Pokemon types or attacks. One of the other important features was `evolve` - a keyword that allowed to filter only Pokemon that could still evolve and the player had enough candies to do so. It was really helpful during mass-evolve sessions with Lucky Eggs, where users wanted to optimize time and avoid wasting it to scroll through the list (some of the previous methods to avoid that were renaming Pokemon and/or favoriting and unfavoriting them).

Another update brought the possibility to craft longer search expressions - which then allowed to add Pokemon IDs to the `evolve` command to limit the list even more - remove semi-evolved Pokemon for example.

Some users came up with nice, ready to use commands that already were skipping semi-evolved Pokemon, sometimes even biome-specific.

Unfortunately, none of them were personalized enough, so this tool was created - to allow everyone to craft their own version of the `evolve` command with Pokemon they want to target in as easy way as possible.

## Usage
Just select Pokemon that you want to evolve and the command will be auto-generated for you in the top box - ready to be copied and pasted into Pokemon GO for your evolve sessions.

## Live Demo
While you can checkout the repository yourself, there's a fully functioning version available on [Github Pages](https://moriakaice.github.io/pokemon-go-evolve-generator/).
